::: {.notes}
This project is the result of a yearly tradition, which started in 2011. I did
discover digital painting in 2008 already, but it took me three years to create
a digitally painted season's greetings card for the first time. Ever since, I
try creating one each year, with a little stop-motion excursion for 2015 (not
included here). In most cases, I try to do something with animals, hinting at
some moments and important steps in my family's lives. All these are created
with a first-gen small Wacom Bamboo fun drawing tablet, in the first few years
with MyPaint and GIMP, but since 2016 with Krita.
